## My process

### Built with

- Vite ReactJS
- CSS Modules
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

By building this webapp with reactJS, I learn a lot about single page application and how to build an app by creating every single components and then assemble them. By building a component one by one, it's very helpful to keep the application easy to understand for beginner developer, and also will make the debugging and maintenance process faster and easier.
